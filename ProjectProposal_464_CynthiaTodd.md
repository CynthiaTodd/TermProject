## Project type:

There is a file in the Montreal open data website that contains the entire inventory of public trees in all of the cities in the agglomeration of Montreal. This file is a csv file but contains coordinate data in order to convert it to a geojson file. By taking the researchers route, I will attempt to accomplish 2 things: 

1. I would like to analyze and manipulate this data. This file lists every single tree, so the first thing i would like to do is analyze the data itself. I am curious to see which species is the most abundant. There is an attribute that indicate the placement of the tree (park, side of the street, side of the park, sidewalk, etc) so I would like to examine the most popular placement of the trees.    
	
2. I will aggregate this data spatially into each dissemination area and adding the sum of the public tree and then I will join the aggregated public tree data with the income data from the CHASS website to analyze the density of public trees per dissemination area and compare the income too see if there is any correlation.
